//Vincent takes up Anton's dare on their old challenge of swimming into the ocean to see who will chicken out first.
Anton: Vincent! How are you doing this Vincent? How have you done any of this? We have to go back.
Vincent: It's too late for that. We're closer to the other side.
Anton: What other side? You wanna drown us both?
Vincent: You wanna know how I did it? This is how I did it Anton: I never saved anything for the swim back.
//Anton gives up the challange and turns around to swim back to the shore.
